# Harvest Moon Haven 
This is an app I made to give back to the Harvest Moon Speedrunners community. We were always talking about how we wish we had a place with up to date notes and a place that we could refer to that has all the correct information. This app is mmy way of providing this ability to make our own site to maintain the routes and hopefully help users to cut down their time.
